# ============================================================
# BM25 Retriever — Keyword-Based Search
#
# WHAT IS BM25?
# BM25 (Best Match 25) is the gold-standard keyword search algorithm.
# It's what traditional search engines (Elasticsearch, Lucene) use.
# Unlike semantic search, BM25 finds documents that share exact words
# with the query, weighted by term frequency and inverse document frequency.
#
# WHY BOTH BM25 AND SEMANTIC SEARCH?
# Neither approach is perfect alone:
# - Semantic search: catches "aspirin" vs "acetylsalicylic acid" (synonyms)
#   but might miss a document that says literally "500mg dosage" when you
#   ask "what is the dose of aspirin?"
# - BM25: catches exact matches but misses synonyms and paraphrases
#
# HYBRID RETRIEVAL (BM25 + Semantic):
# - Run both searches independently
# - Feed their ranked result lists into RRF (Reciprocal Rank Fusion)
# - RRF combines them: chunks appearing high in BOTH lists win
#
# This is called "hybrid retrieval" and consistently outperforms either
# approach alone in RAG benchmarks.
#
# IMPLEMENTATION NOTE:
# The BM25 index is built IN MEMORY at search time by loading documents
# from ChromaDB. For a production system with millions of documents, you'd
# want a persistent BM25 index (e.g., Elasticsearch, Typesense).
# For this project, in-memory BM25 is fine.

        all_documents:  List of document dicts, each with at least a "text" key.
                        Typically loaded from ChromaDB via get_all_documents_metadata()
