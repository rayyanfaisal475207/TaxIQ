# ============================================================
# Chat attachments — files attached to ONE conversation.
#
# THIS IS NOT INGESTION. The distinction matters, so it is enforced here
# rather than left to a filter someone can forget:
#
#   Knowledge base (admin)      | Chat attachment (user)
#   ----------------------------|------------------------------------------
#   chunked + embedded          | text extracted once, never embedded
#   lives in document_chunks    | lives in session_attachments
#   retrievable by every user   | visible only to this conversation
#   permanent, shared           | deleted with the conversation
#
# An attachment's text is injected into the prompt for its own session. It can
# never be returned by retrieval for anyone else, because it is never in the
# table retrieval reads.
