"""
Error capture — persists backend failures so they can be reviewed.

Before this, the only record of an error was a line on stdout: if you weren't
watching the terminal at the time, the failure was simply gone. The admin
dashboard needs an error *history* and a *trend*, which means errors have to be
written down.

Design constraints, in order of importance:

1. **Never break the request.** A failure in error-logging must not raise, must
   not block the event loop, and must not turn a handled error into a 500.
2. **Never recurse.** Writing an error to the database can itself fail; if that
   failure were logged through the same handler we would spin forever. A
   re-entrancy guard plus a logger denylist prevents this.
3. **Never block.** Records go onto an in-memory queue; a single background task
   drains it. If the queue is full we drop the record (and say so) rather than
   applying backpressure to a user request.
