# ============================================================
# Query Rewriter — LLM Call 1
#
# PURPOSE:
# Users often ask follow-up questions that reference previous messages.
# "What about the side effects?" is meaningless without knowing we've
# been talking about aspirin. The query rewriter resolves these references
# by using the conversation history to make the query self-contained.
#
# This is critical for retrieval quality: ChromaDB doesn't know about
# the conversation, it only sees the query text. If you pass in
# "What about the side effects?", ChromaDB will search for "side effects"
# of nothing in particular — and return irrelevant results.
#
# After rewriting: "What are the side effects of aspirin?" — precise search.
#
# RETRY MODE:
# The same rewriter runs again during the retry loop, but with different
# input: instead of just conversation history, it also gets the evaluator's
# feedback about why the previous retrieval failed.
# This produces a more targeted query for the second retrieval attempt.
