"""
Chat attachments vs the knowledge base.

The whole point of the attachment design is that the two systems cannot leak
into each other. These tests pin that guarantee down:

  * an attachment is never chunked, embedded, or written to document_chunks
  * an attachment's text reaches only its own conversation's prompt
  * a knowledge-base upload IS chunked into the same table retrieval reads
  * one user's attachment is invisible to another user

If someone later "helpfully" routes attachments through the ingestion pipeline,
these fail.
