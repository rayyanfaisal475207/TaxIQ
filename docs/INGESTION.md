# Documents in TaxIQ: two systems, deliberately separate

There are two ways a document can enter TaxIQ. They look similar and are not.
Confusing them is the failure mode this design exists to prevent.

|                      | **Knowledge base** | **Chat attachment** |
|----------------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| Who adds it          | Admin, from the admin panel | Any user, from the chat composer |
| What happens to it   | Chunked → embedded → indexed | Text extracted once |
| Where it lives       | `document_chunks` (+ `documents`) | `session_attachments` |
| Who can retrieve it  | **Everyone** — it answers all users' questions | Only that one conversation |
| Lifetime             | Permanent, shared | Dies with the conversation |
| API                  | `POST /api/admin/kb/upload` | `POST /api/attachments` |

## Why they can't leak into each other

The separation is **structural, not a filter**. A chat attachment is never
embedded and never written to `document_chunks` — the table retrieval reads. It
cannot be returned to another user by a search, because it is not in the thing
being searched. There is no flag to forget to set.

Attachment text reaches the model by a different route: it is injected into the
prompt for its own conversation (`build_attachment_context` in
`src/api/attachments.py`), clearly labelled as user-supplied and *not* part of
the tax code, and capped so a large PDF cannot crowd out the statutes retrieved
from the knowledge base.

`tests/test_attachments.py` pins this down. If someone later routes attachments
through the ingestion pipeline "to make them searchable", those tests fail.

## What this replaced

Before, the user-facing app had an "Ingest Files" page and a knowledge-base
manager. Two problems:

1. **It didn't work.** The drag-and-drop staged files in the browser and then
   called `POST /api/ingest`, which only re-scanned the *server's*
   `data/documents/` folder. Nothing was ever uploaded. Users believed they had
   added a document; they had not.
2. **It shouldn't have existed.** Anything ingested landed in the single shared
   corpus with no owner scoping, so one user's file would have been served to
   every other user as tax law. That is not a feature you want on a compliance
   product.

Ingestion is now admin-only, and it really uploads.

## Adding to the knowledge base (admin)

Admin panel → **Knowledge Base** → drop a file. Supported: PDF, DOCX, XLSX, CSV,
HTML, Markdown, plain text, and images (read via vision OCR).

The file is written to `data/documents/`, then chunked and embedded in the
background. Progress is tracked per file in `ingestion_jobs` and shown on the
page as **processing → success / failed**, with the reason on failure. It lands
in the *existing* `document_chunks` table with `is_global = true`; there is no
second store.

## Attaching a file to a conversation (user)

Chat composer → paperclip (or drag onto the composer). Limits: 10 MB, 5 files
per conversation, 12k characters of extracted text per file. A file that yields
no readable text is shown as a failed chip with the reason, rather than
disappearing.

## Migration

Attachments and ingestion status need tables from
`migrations/003_admin_dashboard_and_attachments.sql`. Until it is applied:

* attaching a file returns a clear "run migration 003" message (not a 500),
* the admin dashboard shows an *Instrumentation not applied* banner instead of
  empty charts that would read as a healthy, silent system,
* everything else — chat, retrieval, admin metrics — works as normal.

Apply it by pasting the file into the Supabase SQL editor, or with
`python scripts/apply_migration.py migrations/003_admin_dashboard_and_attachments.sql`
on a network where the direct Postgres connection is reachable.

## A note on the existing corpus

A bug in the chunker meant every chunk was written under its own synthetic
`doc_id` (`unknown_<chunk_id>`), so the `documents` table holds one near-empty
row per chunk for everything ingested before this change. Retrieval was
unaffected (it reads `document_chunks`), but "chunks per document" was
meaningless.

The chunker now carries the parent `doc_id`, so new uploads produce one document
row with a real chunk count. The dashboard reports chunks per document by
grouping on `source_file`, which is correct for the old rows and the new ones
alike. If you want the legacy `documents` rows tidied up, re-ingesting those
files is the clean way to do it.
