# Adapting TaxIQ to New Domains

TaxIQ was built with a highly modular architecture that cleanly separates the core RAG pipeline from domain-specific data and rules. By design, you can transform this system into "HealthIQ", "LegalIQ", or "CyberIQ" with minimal structural changes.

This guide outlines exactly what needs to be swapped out and what components should remain untouched when adapting the codebase for a new domain.

## 🟢 What Stays the Same (Core Architecture)

The majority of the infrastructure is domain-agnostic and should **not** be modified:

1. **Authentication & Security (`src/auth/`)**: 
   - JWT generation, password hashing, and role-based access control (RBAC).
2. **Data Gateway & Persistence (`src/data_gateway/`)**: 
   - The dual `RestGateway` and `DirectGateway` patterns. 
   - The SQLite pipeline logger (`data/pipeline_logs.db`).
3. **Core Orchestration (`src/pipeline/orchestrator.py`)**: 
   - The central loop (Rewrite → Route → Retrieve → Rerank → Evaluate → Generate).
4. **Retrieval Mechanisms (`src/retrieval/`)**:
   - The `ChromaDB` vector store implementation.
   - The `BM25` lexical search algorithm.
   - The Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) logic.
5. **Project & Memory Management (`src/api/projects.py`, `src/pipeline/memory_updater.py`)**:
   - The rolling summary generation and project-scoped conversational memory.

## 🔴 What Needs to Change (Domain-Specifics)

To adapt the system to a new domain, you will primarily update prompts, data schemas, and ingestion logic.

### 1. System Prompts (`prompts/`)
The LLM behavior is entirely controlled by text files in the `prompts/` directory. You must rewrite these to reflect the new domain:
- `query_rewriter.txt`: Update examples to reflect domain-specific terminology (e.g., changing "filer status" to "patient symptoms").
- `router.txt`: Update the few-shot routing examples. Define clearly what constitutes a "RAG" query vs a "DIRECT" conversational query in the new domain.
- `evaluator.txt`: Update the criteria for what makes a retrieved document "relevant" to a query.
- `final_response.txt`: Modify the persona (e.g., "You are an expert Tax Assistant" -> "You are an expert Medical Assistant").

### 2. Structured Data & MCP Tools (`src/mcp/`)
The current SQL route is hardcoded to query a `tax_rates` table.
- **Database Schema**: Drop the `tax_rates` table in PostgreSQL and create new structured tables relevant to your domain (e.g., `drug_interactions`, `case_law_metadata`).
- **MCP Client (`src/mcp/client.py`)**: Update the `execute_query` connection parameters if pointing to a different structured database.
- **SQL Extractor (`src/pipeline/sql_extractor.py`)**: Update the prompt (`sql_param_extractor.txt`) to extract the fields relevant to your new tables (e.g., extracting `drug_name` and `dosage` instead of `tax_type` and `filer_status`).

### 3. Ingestion Pipeline (`src/ingestion/`)
If your new domain requires parsing different file formats (e.g., DICOM images for healthcare, specific XML schemas for legal tech), you must add new loaders:
- Extend `src/ingestion/loaders/` with custom parsers.
- Update `src/ingestion/service.py` to route the new file extensions to your custom loaders.

### 4. Database Models (`src/database/models.py`)
While the `users`, `projects`, and `sessions` tables remain the same, you may want to add custom tables for domain-specific user preferences (e.g., replacing `preferred_language` with `medical_license_number` in the user profile).

## Summary Checklist for a New Domain

- [ ] Clear the ChromaDB vector store (`rm -rf data/chroma_db`).
- [ ] Drop and recreate domain-specific Postgres tables (replace `tax_rates`).
- [ ] Rewrite all 5 `.txt` prompts in the `prompts/` folder.
- [ ] Update `sql_extractor.py` and its prompt to target the new SQL tables.
- [ ] Ingest the new domain's raw documents.
- [ ] (Optional) Update frontend branding and terminology in `frontend/src/`.
